# Wave
2D wave simulation project.

This repository was created for the final project of the NYU "Numerical Methods II" class of the Spring 2016 semester.
It runs a finite differencing 2D wave simulator on input xyz.

# Build
$ make

# Simulation
$ ./wave_simulate.tsk -p <param_file> -o <out_prefix>

where <param_file> is a parameter file that contains values for all the parameters needed for the simulation
and <out_prefix> will be used to name files generated at each step of the simulation:
<out_prefix>_1.xyz
<out_prefix>_2.xyz
...

# Movie
To generate a movie of the wave, run the python script in scripts/wave.py:
$ cd scripts
$ python wave.py <param_file> <out_prefix>

<out_prefix> needs to identify the same files generated by the simulator in the Simulation part above.
This will read the output files generated by the simulator and will create a movie in <out_prefix>.mp4.
